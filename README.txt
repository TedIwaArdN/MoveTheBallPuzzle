Moving the ball puzzles 
v1.0.1
Edward Tian

This puzzle requires the player to use WASD or ↑←↓→ to move the black and white ball to 
the place of the red ball. The only rule is that the ball must move to the nearest wall
ahead. 

The player can also create his own levels by using addVerLine or addHorLine method 
in class Levels. 

For a further development, addVerLine and addHorLine can be simplified into one method, 
like addRect. That way, it will be easier to insert photos of walls in the program. 

Other potential developments: 
1. Add actions when ball is moveing. 
2. Develop 3D levels. 
3. Make demonstrations.
