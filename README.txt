Moving the ball puzzles 1.0.1
Edward Tian

This puzzle requires the player to use WASD or ↑←↓→ to move the black and white ball to 
the place of the red ball. The only rule is that the ball must move to the nearest wall
ahead. 

The player can also create his/her own levels by using addVerLine or addHorLine method 
in class Levels. 

In a further development, addVerLine and addHorLine can be simplified into one method, 
like addRect. That way, it will be easier to insert photos of walls in the program. 

Another potential development is that combat system might be able to add. Player should 
get some equipments to fight against monsters that prevent him/her to reach the final 
point.
